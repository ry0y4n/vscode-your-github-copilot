# My GitHub Copilot

This repository contains the complete code for the article that guides you through implementing custom GitHub Copilot commands.

In this tutorial, you learn how to build a VS Code extension that registers a new Copilot Chat command—**`@security-checker`**—for checking your web application's code for security vulnerabilities.

The article demonstrates how to:

-   Scaffold a TypeScript-based VS Code extension.
-   Create and register a custom Copilot Chat command.
-   Stream responses from a large language model.
-   Automatically reference active files and previous chat history.
-   Integrate external data to enhance security analysis.
-   Package your extension for distribution.
